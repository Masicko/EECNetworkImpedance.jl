## Introduction

The goal is to simulate an impedance measurement of an electrochemical cell of defined structure consisting of YSZ, LSM and pores using electrical elements. 

### Geometry
The structure is defined by a material matrix which contains integers

- *0* : for a YSZ particle (yellow),
- *1* : for a LSM particle (black),
- *2* : for a pore (white).

Material matrix can be also defined by a raster image using colors specified above in brackes.

!["Specified cell geometry"](images/geometry.png?raw=true )

In addition, left and right sides of the matrix is grasped by 1 column of LSZ layer as current collectors. 

!["Cell geometry with electordes"](images/geometry_with_electrodes.png?raw=true )

### Electrochemistry
Physical simulation is done using standard electrical elements - R elements for ohmic resistance and RC element for a double-layer behavior on interfaces of LSM | YSZ. We have the following parameters:

- *R_YSZ* : ohmic resistance of YSZ
- *C_pol_YSZ* : polarization capacitance on YSZ side
- *R_pol_YSZ* : polarization resistance on YSZ side
- *R_LSM* : ohmic resistance of LSM
- *C_pol_LSM* : polarization capacitance on LSM side
- *R_pol_LSM* : polarization resistance on LSM side
- *R_pore* : resistance of pore (is set to very high number as default)


Geometry specific behavior is simulated via interactions between pixels by the manner described in the following picture.

!["Particle impedance scheme"](images/scheme.png?raw=true )


The each impedance *Z* is specified using the information about starting material *M1* and the ending material *M2* (see the picture) in the following manner:

!["Interaction scheme"](images/scheme_interaction.png?raw=true )

- *M1 = YSZ*
  - *M2 = YSZ*  => *Z = R_YSZ/2* 
  - *M2 = LSM*  => *Z = R_YSZ/2 + Z_RC(R_pol_YSZ, C_pol_YSZ)* (including the double-layer on YSZ side)
  - *M2 = pore* => *Z = R_YSZ/2*
- *M1 = LSM*
  - *M2 = YSZ*  => *Z = R_LSM/2 + Z_RC(R_pol_LSM, C_pol_LSM)* (including the double-layer on LSM side)
  - *M2 = LSM*  => *Z = R_LSM/2*
  - *M2 = pore* => *Z = R_LSM/2*
- *M1 = pore* => *Z = R_pore/2*

The factor 1/2 is there so that the total resistance through the whole (e. g.) YSZ particle is *R_YSZ*.

## Installation
The package can be then installed via 
```julialang
]
add https://github.com/Masicko/EECNetworkImpedance.jl
```


## Usage

Before using the package, you have to execute

```julialang
using EECNetworkImpedance
```

### Basics

Supposing we have either 

- `material_matrix = [1 1 1; 0 1 2]`(with values in {0,1,2}) or 
- bitmap image *my_image.png* (with colors {yellow, black, white}). 

In addition, we can specify parameters as a set of pairs. The following are the default parameters:

```julialang
physical_parameters = [ "R_YSZ" => 100, 
                        "R_pol_YSZ" => 0,
                        "C_pol_YSZ" => 0.001, 
                        #
                        "R_LSM" => 1, 
                        "R_pol_LSM" => 40, 
                        "C_pol_LSM" => 0.005, 
                        #
                        "R_pore" => 1000000]
```

Note that `"R_pol_YSZ" => 0` which means only one significant arc should appear in Nyquist diagram and therefore *two point extrapolation* (see below in section Additional options) is viable as resulting to a dramatic speedup. To be precise, more arcs in Nyquist diagram can occure depending on the geometry. For example, even three equally large arcs can be produced using a artificially tailored geometry. However, for an efficient computation on sufficiently large and homogenous geometries, an assumption of one significant arc (and *two point extrapolation*) is valid. 

If less parameters are specified, the others are supposed to be default, i.e.

```julialang
physical_parameters = ["R_YSZ" => 73]
```

The core function is

```julialang
f_list, Z_list = image_to_EIS(material_matrix, physical_parameters)
```

or using path to image file

```julialang
f_list, Z_list = image_to_EIS("images/geometry.png", physical_parameters)
```

or specifying parameters in a function call 

```julialang
f_list, Z_list = image_to_EIS("images/geometry.png", ["R_YSZ" => 73])
```

or without specifying parameters


```julialang
f_list, Z_list = image_to_EIS("images/geometry.png")
```

which returns (by default) frequencies `f_list` for which impedances `Z_list` are computed.

### Additinal options

Practically useful keyword parameters are

- `f_list = [1, 10, 100]` : specification of array of frequencies for which EIS simulation will run. 
  - `= [10.0^n for n in (-3 : 0.5 : 7)]` is a good format for a geometric sequence with base 10.0 (it must be floating point number, not integer 10) and exponent spanning from -3 to 7 with a step 0.5.
  - `= "two_point_extrapolation"` : the simulation is run only for `TPE_f_list_in` yielding two impedances, 
      R-RC circuit is analytically fitted to the two computed impedances. The output Z_list is computed using this R-RC circuit for 
      frequencies in `TPE_f_list_out`.
  - default value is `= "TPE"` : which is a shortcut for "two_point_extrapolation" with the same meaning
- `TPE_f_list_in = [1e-3, 1e6]` by default
- `TPE_f_list_out = [10.0^n for n in (-3 : 0.5 : 7)]` by default
- `TPE_warning = true` : if true and `"TPE" = true`, a warning about performing TPE is printed to standard output. 
- `pyplot = true` : if *false*, no Nyquist plot is plotted
- `return_R_RC = false` :
  - if `= true` : the output of function `image_to_EIS` is a tripple (R_ohm, R_pol, C_pol) from R-RC circuit
  - if `= false` : the output is a tuple `(f_list, Z_list)`
- `export_z_file = ""` : decides whether a standard file for Z_view is exported
  - default value is `= ""`, which means *do nothing*
  - if `= "some_file.z"` : exports to this file
  - if `= "!use_file_name"` : this option is valid only when the function `image_to_EIS` was **called with a path of image**, e. g. "images/geometry.png"
  and it means that z_file will have a form "images/geometry.z", i. e. changes only the extension to ".z"
- `save_also_image = ""
  - if "example.png" : the image will be saved with this name
  - if `!asZfile` : if `export_z_file != ""` and than the input image is copied with a name of `export_z_file` but with the extension ".png"
  - if `!input` : if `image_to_EIS` was **called with a path of image**
- `store_R_RC` : turns on the evaluation of R_RC element from two points of computed impedance and append the output to a specified file
  - if `= ""` : means *do nothing* (which is default)
  - if `= "storage.txt"` : append a line formated as <dateTtime> tab <input_file_name> tab <R_ohm> tab <R_pol> tab <C_pol> . If the function was called with a matrix (not an path to file), `"<matrix_input>"` is written instead of <input_file_name>.
  - if `= "storage.csv"` : csv extension works too
- `return_specific_impedance = true` : returns specific impedance in *ohms x cm*. Also values of fitted *R_RC* circuit will be returned in specific units.
- `L_el_mat = i_LSM` : defines material of the left electrode adjacent to the specified material matrix. Possible options are `i_LSM` (default) or `i_YSZ`.
- `R_el_mat = i_LSM` : the same for the right electrode material.

Advanced keyword parameters are 

- `complex_type = ComplexF64` : changes the data type in which the impedance calculation is performed
- `iterative_solver = "auto"` : for small problems (under $15^3$ voxels) is used direct solver and iterative for larger ones.
  - if `= false` : the system of equations is solved by a direct LU solver (julian `\` operator)
  - if `= true` : the system is solved by iterative solver using Biconjugate gradient stabilized method with using Crout version of incomplete LU decomposition as a preconditioner.
- `fill_in_ratio = 12`: defines expected fill during the incomplete LU desomposition. It is a ratio of non-zero element count of aproximation of `L` matrix with respect to non-zero element count of original `A` matrix of the (sparse) linear system. Bigger `fill_in_ratio` means more realiable convergence of iterative solver but it requires more RAM space, which is the limiting factor for large systems (e.g. $10^6$ voxels and above).
- `tau = "auto"`: a drop criterion parameter in incomplete LU process. It is a absolute (not relative) treshold and elements of size under this treshold are forgotten. If `"auto"`, an adaptive process is run to estimate a feasible value for `tau` for which the defined `fill_in_ratio` is achieved.
- `compute_tortuosity = true` means that tortuosity of the domain will be computed and stored in the output in the column `tor`.

#### Lower level API 
A user can directly access the computational core using function `material_matrix_to_impedance()` which accepts arguments these non-keyword arguments

- `material_matrix`
- `physical_parameters`

and keyword arguments

- `f_list`
- `complex_type`
- `iterative_solver`
- `verbose` : if `true`, every demanding computation step is measured using a macro `@time`
- `return_only_linsys` : if `true` : the linear system of equations is constructed and returned as a tuple $(A, b)$ - matrix $A$ and right-hand-side $b$. The system is not solved.
- `tau`
- `fill_in_ratio`

### Real Example

```julialang
image_to_EIS(   [1 0 1; 0 1 2], 
                ["R_YSZ" => 73],
                #
                export_z_file="test.z", 
                return_R_RC=true,
                save_also_image="!asZfile",
                store_R_RC = ""
                )
```


## Generate random domain with structure

Automated generating of random structure is essential for statistical testing of system behavior. There are a few helping features using two main parameters. 

- `porosity` in [0, 1] : the ratio of pores over the total points (material points + pores) in the picture. 
- `LSM_ratio` in [0, 1] : probability that the material point will be LSM.

### Simple homogenous matrix
The simplest example is a homogenous domain of `dimensions = (m, n)`, where *m* is a number of rows and *n* a number of columns. Matrix of this type can be constructed via

```julialang
homogenous_matrix = generate_matrix(dimensions, porosity, LSM_ratio)
```

### Additional stuctural parameters
More specific structure can be defined using parameters which governs a tendency to group pixels together. Namely:

- `pore_cavitance = Nothing`- a probability that next pore pixel will spawn next to already existing pore (if possible)
  - if `= Nothing`, generating of random structure is fast because no "grouping algoritm" is involved.
  - if `= 0.0`, generating of random structure is slower because "grouping algoritm" is invoked
- `LSM_cavitance = 0.0`- a probability that next LSM pixel will spawn next to already existing LSM pixel (if possible). This keyword argument is working only if pore_cavitance keyword parameter is set to a real number (i.e. if `pore_cavitance = Nothing`, then parameter `LSM_cavitance` has no effect to generated structure).

```julialang
pseudo_homogenous_matrix = generate_matrix(dimensions, porosity, LSM_ratio, 
                                            pore_cavitance = 0.4,
                                            LSM_cavitance = 0.2
                          )
```

### Rotation of domain
Generated domain can be rotated by function

```julialang
rotate_matrix!(domain, step, axis)
```

which rotates the input domain (and changes it). There is a version (withoug the exclamation mark `!`) which does not change the original domain and returns the new rotated domain

```julialang
new_domain = rotate_matrix(domain, step, axis)
```

The parameters are
- `step` specifing the number of simple rotations. 1 = 90°, 2 = 180°, 3 = 270°, 4 = 360°, 5 = 450°. And -1 = 90° backwards etc... 
- `axis` from the set `["x", "y", "z"]` specifies the axis of rotation. Note, the current flows along `"y"` axis, therefore rotation aroud this axis does not change the output impedance.

### Inspecting domain properties
Voxels in domain can be marked by a number, which will specify its material connectivity character. In particular,

 - 0 - pore
 - 1 - izolated material (not connected to electrodes)
 - 2 - material connected to left electrode
 - 3 - material connected to right electrode
 - 4 - material connected to both electrodes (only this voxels can participate on electric current flow)

 This investigation is dome by function 
 
 ```julialang
characterize_material_izolation(material_matrix)
 ```

 which returns matrix labeled as described above. In order to compute ratio of izolated material, there is a function

```julialang
izolated_material_ratio(material_matrix, wanted_ids = [1,2,3])
```
 
 which return the ratio of "wanted_material_points / all_material_points". Defaut value is `wanted_ids = [1]` for strongly izolated voxels.

### Structure using multiple submatrices
For more complicated domains composed of several different homogenous subdomains, there is a possibility to construct appropriate matrix. Suppose we want to construct *m* x *n* matrix consisting of 2 different submatrices. First, a list of submatrices must be created such that one submatrix is represented by its *location* (left upper corner and right lower corner) in the resulting matrix and *porosity* and *LSM_ratio*. 

```julialang
    # the structure for each submatrix in the list is >>
    # 
    # [left upper coord, right lower coord,  porosity,   LSM_ratio]
    
submatrix_list = [        
    [(1,1),             (10, 5),            0.2,          0.5],   # this is the first submatrix
    [(1,6),             (10, 10),           0.0,          1.0]    # this is the second submatrix
]

two_subdomain_matrix = generate_matrix(submatrix_list)
```

There can be more subdomains in `submatrix_list`. Dimensions of the resulting `two_subdomain_matrix` is computed as en rectangular envelope of all *locations* in `submatrix_list`. The submatrices can overlap (in this case, the latter has priority in evaluation of matrix), but **every pixel must be covered** by the submatrices.

#### Three column domain template
There is a template using the upper structure of defying submatrices, which generates a domain of 3 columns with defined material specification (*porosity* and *LSM_ratio*). In addition, there are contacts (of width 1 and optional height) on the left side providing an interesting distribution of electrical current through the system. The right side consists of a continuous one layer of LSM as a connection to conductive electrolyte. The obligate input parameters are 

- `LSM_ratio1`, `LSM_ratio2`, `LSM_ratio3`

Optional parameters (with default values) are 

- `porosity1=0.5, porosity2=0.5, porosity3=0.5`
- `positions_of_contacts=[15, 50]` : starting row for each LSM contact 
- `height_of_contacts=5`
- `column_width=5`
- `height=70`

in this default case, the LSM contacts will be between [15, 20] and [50, 55] pixels of the first column while the whole matrix has height of 70 pixels. The submatrix list can be then obtained by function `three_column_domain_template` and then inserted to `generate_matrix`.

```julialang
LSM_ratio1 = 0.2
LSM_ratio2 = 1.0
LSM_ratio3 = 0.5

template_submatrix_list = three_column_domain_template(LSM_ratio1, LSM_ratio1, LSM_ratio1,
                                     #                              
                                     column_width = 10,
                                     porosity1 = 0.0, porosity3 = 0.2,
                                     positions_of_contacts=[20, 45], height_of_contacts=4
                                 )
                        
three_column_matrix = generate_matrix(template_submatrix_list)
```

## Material matrix visualization

A material matrix can be saved to a file with specified `path` using `matrix_to_file` function. For example

```julialang
matrix_to_file("images/three_column_domain.png", three_column_matrix)
```

!["Three column domain"](images/three_column_domain.png?raw=true )

## Enlarge image

The images are often very small (50 pixels). So for a better view, there is a utility to make bigger resolution.

```julialang
enlarge_image(path; resolution=nothing, resize_factor=nothing, print_bool=false)
```

Parameters are

- `path`: path for the source image. The processed (enlarged) image is than saved to `"path_resized.XXX"`
- `resolution = nothing` you can choose if you want to specify the target resolution as an integer (it assumes squared pictures)
  - `resolution = 100` makes a resized picture with dimensions 100x100 pixels
- `resize_factor = nothing` or you can choose resizing factor, such that
  - `resize_factor = 3` means it will make 150x150 if the input image was 50x50
- `print_bool = false` ... if `true`, a name of resized picture is printed to terminal

## In-depth surface visualization

The function `make_shaded_view` takes a 3D structure `domain` and makes a 2D surface view such that it colors visible material pixels according to their depth in the structure. The basic usage is 

```julialang
make_shaded_view(domain, file_name, grad_depth=15, side=1, only_palette = false,
                            LSM_s = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3), LSM_e = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                            YSZ_s = (1.0, 0.8, 0.0), YSZ_e = (0.5, 0.4, 0.0),
                            pall_func = x->x
                          )
```
Parameters are 

- `grad_depth = 15` 
- `only_palette = false`: if `true`, the output image is not the 2D surface view but only the palletes of colors
- `LSM_s`, `LSM_e`: starting and ending RGB color for gray LSM palette. Similarly, `YSZ_s` and `YSZ_e` for yellow YSZ pallete.
- `pall_func = x -> x`: user can define a function how pallete color should progress from start to end. The `x -> x` means linear progress. The input parameter `x` goes from 0 to 1 and the output of the function is expected also in the interval `[0, 1]`. There is a predefined symmetrical logaritmic function 
    - ` = sym_log(x, a)` which has the value `0.5` for `x = 0.5` and behaves as a logarithm in interval `[0.0, 0.5]` and is point-wise symmetric around the midpoint `x,y = (0.5, 0.5)`. The parameter `a` governs the "logarithmic steepness" in the beginng. `a = 1` is almost linear, `a = 1000` is very steep
- `side = 1`: defines, which side od the cube domain is inspected. In particular, the coding is 1 = do not rotate, 2 = 90° along x, 3 = 180° along x, 4 = 270° along x, 5 = 90° along y, 6 = -90° along y

## Matrix compilation of subimages

One can generate a lot of images using this package. There is also a tool to make a matrix of images based on row and column indexes:

```julialang
subimages_composition(folder_path = "data/set_of_images/", 
                      row_numbers = collect(0.2 : 0.1 : 0.7), 
                      col_numbers = collect(0.2 : 0.05 : 0.4), 
                      template = "img_por#(row)_LSM#(col).png",
)
```

where there parameters are

- `template = "img_por#(row)_LSM#(col)"` where the sequence `#(row)` will be replaced by a number from the list `row_numbers` nad the same holds for `#(col)`. Note that it is not `$(col)` so that it will not colide with the internal julia string interpolation.
- `background_color = (1,1,1)` RGB definition of background color. White is default.
- `del_width = 10` number of pixels separating subimages
- `out_filename = "compilation.png"` and output file is located in `folder_path`
